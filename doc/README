My initial CO2 calculations came from Reference [1]. That has a national number
of 884.2 lbs CO2/MWh. Joe has a slightly lower number in his table of 700lbs
CO2/MWh for Northeast Region - so it makes sense to use that. For a 700W
computer I originally did

   (comp_power)*(PUE)*(hours per yr)*(CO2lbs/kwh)*(computer utilization)/
   (lbs per metric tonne)

    0.700*1.25*(365*24)*0.84*0.9/2204 = 2.6

Redoing with regional number and PUE from latest MGHPCC facility chart I get

  0.700*1.14*(365*24)*0.7*0.9/2204 = 2

Attached images are from monthly MGHPCC operations reviews.  PUE (green curve on
the line chart) is running at 1.14. You can see seasonal variations due to
chillers being needed in summer. PUE official definition is annual average.  Bar
chart shows the various bits of facility infrastructure that are on the facility
side of the electricity company transformer. These are what goes into the PUE
numerator.
